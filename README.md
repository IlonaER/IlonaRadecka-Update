My experience

My previous experience varies from office assistance through customer service support to label coordinator at a medical company.
I my career I have participated in two projects where I was able to test software as a user. One of them was testing web-based ticketing system Rave 2.0 and the other concerned web-based application for label creation and maintenance Kallik. In both cases I did not have any test cases or scenarios prepared, I have been following processes and using my experience. Bugs found by me was reported to supervisor using Excel file. Right now I am also active as a tester at Testbirds.
